A project that me and a friend are working on for fun
You should not yet be seeing this unless you are working on it with me lol

# How to download
1. Click the "Code" button
2. Select "Download ZIP"
3. Extract it on your computer
Either that, or if you're technical you can clone it w/ Git or GitHub Desktop lol

# How to run
5. Make sure Python is installed (Their website is [here](https://www.python.org/), then open up command prompt.
6. Run the command `cd <directory>` where <directory> is where you extracted the zipped folder.
7. Run `pip install pygame` to download required libraries (you only have to do this once)
8. Run `python main.py` to run the program!
